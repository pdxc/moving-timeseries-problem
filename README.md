# Moving Timeseries Problem

This is a sample app solving the problem outlined below:

1. You are supposed to render a time series chart keeping x-axis ranging from 5 mins ago to current minute (step of the x-axis is 10 seconds)
2. By default line1, line2 and line3 would be producing default value of 1 unit , 2 units, 3 units respectively per every 10 seconds
3. On clicking lineX+ (X can be 1,2,3) button it would add 1 unit counter (if you press 2 times it would add 2 units) for the next data point
4. On clicking lineX- (X can be 1,2,3) button it would subtract 1 unit counter (if you press 2 times it would remove 2 units) for the next iteration
5. The graph should constantly move in the left direction every 10 seconds.

See moving-graph.png for a sketch of what the app could look like.
